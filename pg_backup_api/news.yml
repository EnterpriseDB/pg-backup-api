        - |
          BREAKING: The `/servers/server_name/operations` endpoint now returns a
          list of dictionaries containing keys `id` and `type` instead of the list
          of operation IDs which was returned by previous versions.
        - |
          BREAKING: The `/servers/server_name/operations/operation_id` endpoint now
          returns `operation_id` and `status` instead of `recovery_id` and `status`
          which were returned by previous versions.
      Minor changes:
        - Improved help strings and documentation for command line options.
      Bugfixes:

          Allow pg-backup-api subcommands such as `status` to work regardless of
          whether pg-backup-api was installed from source or from packages.
        - |
          Fix exit code for `pg-backup-api status` so that it is zero if the command
          completes successfully and non-zero otherwise.
        - |
          Fix the `Backup <BACKUP> does not exist` error message so it includes the
          ID of the requested backup.

    changes:

          Access to barman-api.log is now only required when running under a WSGI
          server. This means pg-backup-api commands like status will no longer fail
          if they are executed by a user that cannot access barman-api.log.`

          The baseurl is /servers/<server_name>/operations and it can be used

          created as in /servers/<server_name>/operations/<operation_id>
        - |
